covered:\n- an in-memory store for testing purposes\n- a file-based implementation for basic production environments\n- a database- or ldap-backed implementation for clustered environments, where a file can arrive through multiple directories\n\nI got a bit deep into the code today in the FileConsumer and have added options for *idempotent* so you can keep track of already consumed files.\n\nSee my new post on the nabble forum with this idea.\n\nJon do you mind review the commited source code on trunk. Sorry for invading this ticket, but the re factor of the file consumer needed to be done in one go as to have most unit test still passing. The commits will be on CAMEL-1112\nTo review:\n- I have set the default cache size of the memory to 1000, is this a good default value?\n- FileConsumer code\n- file.getName is that a sufficient key for idempotent check (should we use absolute file name instead?)\n- Is the header keys for index/total a good key name?\n- Should idempotent be enabled by default?\n\nNotice for unit tests that want to consume files but not delete: noop=true&idempotent=true will be as before, only consuming the file ones and not delete the source files.\nMessageIdRepository should be renamed and moved to org.apache.camel.spi\nMessageIdRepository -> IdempotentRepository\n\nSee nabble post with James suggestion for this.\n\n\nJames had a good idea about the interface methods\n\nHow about following the Set naming convention?\n\nboolean add(element) // Returns true if this set did not already\ncontain the specified element.\n\nboolean contains(element) // for peek\nBTW: I am currently working on moving the idempotent repository to the spi package.\n\nShould we support generic, like the Set contract?\n\nShould it be:\npublic interface IdempotentRepository<E>\nOr without the <E> and using Object as the key type?\n\nI currently have the generics version\n\n\nI know we've been removing generics all over the place in Camel lately... I like it in this case though. +1 to your current code.\n\nClaus, you've pretty much completed this task so I'm assigning it to you so you get the credit :)\n+1\nJon, let's have joint credit, we are a team after all ;)\n\nI am wondering if we / I should dig deeper to do something with the MemoryIdempotentRepository as it states that you should be careful with the cache Map to avoid memory leeks.\n\nI was wondering if we could get the Service interface with start/stop to eg. clear the cache on stop. But I guess the callback of Service is not invoked on the idempotent node. Well something to think about.\n\nAny thoughts?\nMaybe noop=true should also make idempotent=true. It makes sense *not* to process the same file over and over again.\nD:\\project\\camel>svn commit --message \"CAMEL-1099: Introduced IdempotentRepository in the spi package.\"\nSending        camel-core\\src\\main\\java\\org\\apache\\camel\\component\\file\\FileComponent.java\nSending        camel-core\\src\\main\\java\\org\\apache\\camel\\component\\file\\FileConsumer.java\nSending        camel-core\\src\\main\\java\\org\\apache\\camel\\component\\file\\FileEndpoint.java\nSending        camel-core\\src\\main\\java\\org\\apache\\camel\\model\\IdempotentConsumerType.java\nSending        camel-core\\src\\main\\java\\org\\apache\\camel\\model\\ProcessorType.java\nSending        camel-core\\src\\main\\java\\org\\apache\\camel\\processor\\idempotent\\IdempotentConsumer.java\nAdding         camel-core\\src\\main\\java\\org\\apache\\camel\\processor\\idempotent\\MemoryIdempotentRepository.java\nDeleting       camel-core\\src\\main\\java\\org\\apache\\camel\\processor\\idempotent\\MemoryMessageIdRepository.java\nDeleting       camel-core\\src\\main\\java\\org\\apache\\camel\\processor\\idempotent\\MessageIdRepository.java\nAdding         camel-core\\src\\main\\java\\org\\apache\\camel\\spi\\IdempotentRepository.java\nSending        camel-core\\src\\test\\java\\org\\apache\\camel\\builder\\RouteBuilderTest.java\nSending        camel-core\\src\\test\\java\\org\\apache\\camel\\component\\file\\FileConsumerIdempotentRefTest.java\nSending        camel-core\\src\\test\\java\\org\\apache\\camel\\processor\\IdempotentConsumerTest.java\nSending        components\\camel-jpa\\src\\main\\java\\org\\apache\\camel\\processor\\idempotent\\jpa\\JpaMessageIdRepository.java\nSending        components\\camel-spring\\src\\test\\java\\org\\apache\\camel\\component\\test\\TestEndpointTest.java\nSending        components\\camel-spring\\src\\test\\resources\\org\\apache\\camel\\component\\test\\TestEndpointTest-context.xml\nTransmitting file data ..............\nCommitted revision 722088.\n- Refactor idempotent interface to spi package *DONE*\n- Wiki sample how to use the Jpa store provided by camel-jpa *DONE*\n- Add a file based repository *DONE*\n- Wiki sample how to use the File store *DONE*\nClaus, I wouldn't spend too much time on the MemoryIdempotentRepository, I don't think many users would want to use this in a production scenario (the file and jpa options are much more attractive). The best we can do in this case is recommend the LRU cache option so the memory doesn't get too out of hand I guess.\nJon, others?\n\nAny good ideas of the file based repository?\n\nI am wondering if we should\n- have the LRUCache as a 1st level cache, and have write through to the file store when adding, using append\n- load the filestore on startup\n- configurable filename and folder\n- use camel file component to read/write (configuration could then be a file endpoint = \"file://data/idempotentrepository.txt?append=true&autoCreate=true\")\nSo when there is a miss on the LRUCache, the file repository would be queried (and this is the only case that it would queried)? I'm just wondering what kind of format we want for this kinda file... having it appended to with every add seems to imply that it would be a big list that we'd have to scroll through (very slow). Maybe I'm missing an obvious solution, it is early here :)\nWill think about this some more when I get into the office. I bet there are some very cool file based index things in KahaDB though http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq/trunk/kahadb/\nWell the file list will be loaded at startup and then only used for write when there is a cache *miss*, so there would not be a performance hit at runtime.\n\nI think it's overkill to use some kind of 3rd party lib\n\nupdated: a miss of course ;)\nMakes sense (now that I'm fully caffeinated :) )\n", "issueSearchSentences": ["boolean add(element) // Returns true if this set did not already", "file.getName is that a sufficient key for idempotent check (should we use absolute file name instead?)", "boolean contains(element) // for peek", "have the LRUCache as a 1st level cache, and have write through to the file store when adding, using append", "Well the file list will be loaded at startup and then only used for write when there is a cache *miss*, so there would not be a performance hit at runtime."], "issueSearchScores": [0.8104384541511536, 0.7863789796829224, 0.7789136171340942, 0.7537911534309387, 0.7481759190559387]}
