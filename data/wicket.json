There is also a problem though in that it attempts to iterate through the window indexes and at the same time calls removePage() which removes them so you get a ConcurrentModificationException. I've tested the following and it works\n\n\tpublic void removePage(int pageId)\n\t{\n\t\tif (idToWindowIndices == null)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\trebuildIndices();\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tList indicesList = (List) idToWindowIndices.get(pageId);\n\t\tif (indicesList == null)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\treturn; // Return if page was already removed\n\t\t}\n\n\t        Object[] indices = indicesList.toArray();\n        \tfor (int i=0; i < indices.length; i++)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tPageWindowInternal window = (PageWindowInternal)windows.get((Integer)indices[i]);\n\t\t\tremovePage(window.pageId, window.versionNumber, window.ajaxVersionNumber);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\nHowever I ran into another problem. When my page removes itself it then gets immediately added back in at the end of the request cycle in Session.requestDetached(). So its impossible for a page to expire itself. To fix this I would recommend changing the PageMap.remove(Page) method to\n\n\tpublic final void remove(final Page page)\n\t{\n\t\t// Remove the pagemap entry from session\n\t\tremoveEntry(page.getPageMapEntry());\n\t        // Make sure it doesn't get added again at the end of the request cycle\n        \tSession.get().untouch(page);\n\t}\n\nand then add the untouch() method to Session\n\n\t/**\n\t* THIS METHOD IS NOT PART OF THE WICKET PUBLIC API.

I wish we had more reports like this. I've attempted to fix the issue, can you plese test if the current trunk works for you?\nIn the removePage() method you removed the indicesList.toArray() so I now get a ConcurrentModificationException because the code tries to iterate through a list at the same time it's removing items. You could use something like this\n\n\tpublic void removePage(int pageId)\n\t{\n\t\tif (idToWindowIndices == null)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\trebuildIndices();\n\t\t}\n\t\tList indices = (List)idToWindowIndices.get(pageId);\n\n\t\tif (indices != null)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tObject[] indicesArray = indices.toArray(); // Make a copy of the list so we don't get a ConcurrentModificationException\n\t\t\tfor (int i=0; i < indicesArray.length; i++)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tint index = ((Integer)indicesArray[i]).intValue();\n\t\t\t\tPageWindowInternal window = (PageWindowInternal)windows.get(index);\n\t\t\t\tif (window.pageId == pageId)\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\tremovePage(window.pageId, window.versionNumber, window.ajaxVersionNumber);\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\nThe other alternative would be to pass the iterator through to the removePage() method so it can call Iterator.remove() but this seems a lot more complicated. Also the list should never really be that big so copying it to an array shouldn't impact performance.\n"}

This is often useful but also can be really nasty sometimes. Imagine you have a text input field to enter the ISBN of a book (size: 13 digits). While typing any parts of the book's title, author, genre, year or ISBN the autocompleter should pop up a list of book entries which contain the matching input string:\n\n  autocompleter output (structure)\n\n  --- item 1 ---\n  ISBN 1\n  AUTHOR 1\n  TITLE 1\n  GENRE 1\n  YEAR 1 \n  --- item 2 ---\n  ISBN 2\n  AUTHOR 2\n  TITLE 2\n  GENRE 2\n  YEAR 2\n  --------------\n  ...\n  --- item n ---\n\nWhen pressing enter the input field will be set to the ISBN of the currently selected book.\n\nBTW since WICKET-488 is resolved the other read-only fields of the form will contain title, author, etc. (Thanks, Igor!! :-)\n\nNow the problem: Typically the width of the autocompleter entry shown in the popup (especially the book title) will be a lot longer than the 13 digit ISBN number. The only chance to grow the wicket autocompleter window to the required size is to make the input field ridiculously long so the windows will adjust to that size. This is really ugly and wastes a lot of space in the user interface for no reason. Also it will confuse the user who thinks the input really needs to be that long.\n\nTypically wicket's autocompleter markup looks like this:\n\n HTML\n\n  <div id=\"isbn1-autocomplete-container\" style=\"overflow: auto; position: absolute; left: 8px; top: 30px; width: 155px;\" class=\"wicket-aa-container\">\n  \t  <div class=\"wicket-aa\" id=\"text1-autocomplete\">\n\t\t  <ul>\n  \t\t      <li class=\"selected\" textvalue=\"978-1932394986\">.....</li>\n\t\t      <li textvalue=\"978-1932394222\">.....</li>\n\t\t      ....\n\t\t      <li textvalue=\"978-1932311186\">.....</li>\n\t\t  </ul>\n\t  </div>\n  </div>\n\nThe 'style' attribute in the <div> contains 'width:155px' and is impossible to override from CSS because 'style' is \"stronger\" (the 'cascading' in css).\n\nSo I attached a patch to enable / disable the adjustment of the width to the input field.\n\n  JAVA\n\n    final AutoCompleteSettings opts = new AutoCompleteSettings();\n    opts.setAdjustInputWidth(false);\n    field.add(new AutoCompleteBehavior(renderer, opts)\n    ...\n\nThe markup will now look like this:\n\n  HTML\n\n    <div id=\"isbn1-autocomplete-container\" style=\"overflow: auto; position: absolute; left: 8px; top: 30px;\" class=\"wicket-aa-container\">\n\nNotice the lack of the 'width' attribute...\n\nNow to resolve the problem you could write:\n\n  MYSTYLE.CSS\n\n    .wicket-aa-container {\n      width: 300px; \n    }\n\nHowever this will not only grow the great book autocompleter to the desired width but also all other autocompleters ever being used on the same page (or the scope of the CSS). Also you can _NOT_ do this:\n\n  MYSTYLE.CSS\n\n    #isbn1-autocomplete-container {\n      width: 300px;\n    }\n\nBecause a linked stylesheet is typically static (and cached by the browser) and the DOM id of the autocompleter is generated dynamically. And, no: I don't consider generating dynamic CSS an option for such a simple problem.\n\nSo what would be just great is the possibility to add an extra css class to the container tag:\n\n  JAVA\n\n    final AutoCompleteSettings opts = new AutoCompleteSettings();\n    opts.setCssClassName(\"book-autocompleter\");\n    opts.setAdjustInputWidth(false);\n    field.add(new AutoCompleteBehavior(renderer, opts)\n    ...\n\n  HTML\n\n    <div id=\"isbn1-autocomplete-container\" style=\"overflow: auto; position: absolute; left: 8px; top: 30px;\" class=\"wicket-aa-container book-autocompleter\">\n\nYou will immediately notice the additional class name 'book-autocompleter'\n\n  MYSTYLE.CSS\n\n    .book-autocompleter {\n      width: 300px;\n    }\n\n\nTo summarize my patch:\n\n\nTwo extra methods in org.apache.wicket.extensions.ajax.markup.html.autocomplete.AutoCompleteSettings\n\n\n  /**\n   * Sets an CSS class name to add to the autocompleter markup container\n   * <p/>\n   * This makes it easier to have multiple autocompleters in your application\n   * with different style and layout.\n   *\n   * @param cssClassName valid CSS class name\n   */\n  public void setCssClassName(final String cssClassName)\n\n\n  /**\n   * Adjust the width of the autocompleter selection window to the width of the related input field.\n   * <p/>\n   * Otherwise the size will depend on the default browser behavior and CSS.\n   *\n    * @param adjustInputWidth  <code>true</code> if the autocompleter should have the same size  as\n   *                           the input field, <code>false</code> for default browser behavior\n   */\n    public void setAdjustInputWidth(final boolean adjustInputWidth)\n\n\nUnless you call these methods the autocompleter will behave exactly as before so this will not break previous code.\n\n\nWould be just great to see this patch applied :-)\nWow, that was quick! Thank you :-)\n"}

But, it is visually obvious in this example that it is not desired behaviour.\n\nFYI, it's based on Emond's own quickstart.\ndoesn't adding custom predicate in @Subscribe  solves the problem? \n\n\n\nNot really, because if you post on the event bus with two clients registered, if I understand things correctly, the predicate which returns true sends the response to both clients, even if the other one returns false.\n\nLet me explain a little more what is the current behaviour. Let's say that two clients A & B have the right @Subscribe method. Let's say that you send an event e to the event bus for that method. Then A processes e and sends the same response to both A & B. Then B processes the same event and sends a response to both A & B, too. So we have two responses received by both A & B. I have an app where it's visually obvious: I send a small notification in my @Subscribe method. The notification displays two times in each browser A & B. Which is what make me think it works like that. Plus, it looks consistent with what I know from Atmosphere's Meteor API (which is called under the hood). Hence the request for a Broadcaster-based solution.\n\nIf I use a predicate which returns true for A and false for B, here is what apparently occurs: A sends its response to both A & B since the predicate returns true. And B doesn't send anything since the predicate returns false. But the * same * response returns to both A & B since it comes from A.\n\nWhat I would like to be able to do is to have a response computed by B's AtmosphereBehavior instance sent to B and a response computed by A's AtmosphereBehavior instance sent to A. Because those 2 responses can potentially be a little bit different from each other.\n\nDoes it make sense? Am I doing assumptions that I should not?\n\nOne more thing. Quoting wicket-atmosphere's JavaDoc: \"The filter cannot rely on any context. For example, the RequestCycle may not be available\". This seems to me a little bit limited. I fully understand why this is like this for the predicate. But if we have a way to dispatch the right event to the right @Subscribe method (or a channel implementation of any sort), maybe we will be able to filter things with more context, so that would be potentially easier.\n\nOK, any thoughts about that?\n\nKind regards,\n\nPierre\nsee code below,i mean something like this,you can change/improve according to your usecase\n\n public class InputWrapper<T> {\n        /**\n         *\n         * @param input\n         * @param id  id is sessionid of sender\n         */\n        public InputWrapper(T input, String  id){\n            this.input=input;\n            this.sender=id;\n        }\n\n        public T getInput() {\n            return input;\n        }\n\n        public String getSender() {\n            return sender;\n        }\n\n        T input;\n        String sender;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * compare sessionid and return true if session id of sender is same as receiver\n     */\n    public  class SomePredicate implements Predicate<InputWrapper>{\n        @Override\n        public boolean apply(@Nullable InputWrapper wrapper) {\n            return wrapper.getSender().equals(Session.get().getId());\n        }\n    }\n\n\nYes, that's totally it! But unfortunately, my arguments below still apply.\n\nPlus, it gives me strange exceptions to use this kind of things: UnknwonBehaviorIdException, NullPointerException because the appended component can't be found, etc. I tried using this kind of code but was forced to strip it because of these exceptions.\nafaik what wicket-atmosphere does is it filters the overall subscribers based on if their corresponding predicate returns true or not when event is posted ,if a predicate of subscriber returns true then the method/subscriber gets invoked else not so in above case with \"SomePredicate\" if client A has sent response then predicate returns true only if A is receiver and hence only A gets response.\ni can't reproduce your exception...\nUnfortunately, my experience is that if a predicate matches for a client and doesn't matches for the others, the matching predicate sends the response to all clients. So in our case the message is sent only once, and not as many times as there are connected clients, but to all the connected clients. Which I find pretty annoying.\n\nRegarding my exception, it only happens when using complex HTML, in one of my projects, it is totally absent. But in another one, it happens on a regular basis.\nI agree that the filter construction is a bit weak. It can only be used to filter on properties of the event itself, not on properties of the receiver. The reason for this is that it is expensive to setup the entire context, such as the session and a request cycle. I think it should be possible to add a second filter that runs inside the AtmosphereRequestHandler, at which point the session, request cylcle and even the page are available.\nI've just pushed the implementation of a context aware filter. I've also updated the example to show how this works. Be advised though that filtering within the context of a Wicket request cyle is expensive. If you can implement the desired behavior via the Atmosphere API, I suggest you do so, because that should be much less expensive.\n\nWrapping the Atmosphere api is not what Wicket-Atmosphere is for, it is a bridge not a wrapper.\nGood evening,\n\nI've just tried it. The behaviour is the same: if three clients are connected and that only one's filter returns true, then the same message goes to all the three clients. If two of them return true, then those two send the message to the three clients, and so on.\n\nPersonally, I'd like to be able to have the message sent by one client broadcasted to only this client. Of course, the use case of \"one client sends to all\" is useful, I just wish it was not the only one possible.\n\nAnyway, your \"contextAwareFilter\" is useful, thanks for that !\n\nI've tried myself to implement a Broadcaster-based message-sending in your code, but for the moment, I failed. Too bad. The one thing I miss is how to provide an AtmosphereResource to my Broadcaster.\n\nAnyway, keep up the good work! :-)\nI don't see how you could return true for one client and false for another (other than using something like random). filter() is used with no receiver context at all. It is meant to be used to filter certain types of events (other than the actual instance type). For example, if you have an event that contains progress of a job and you only want your component to receive the events if the progress is 80% or higher, that's when you use filter(). The same filter should always return true for the same events.\n\nCan you take a look at commit a5421ec488020a3835d49962e1f772dc1435e230? I've added methods to post an event to a single resource, either with a resource instance or via its uuid (which I think makes more sense). You can get the UUID with AtmosphereResource.getUUID(page).\nThanks again! I've tried this new code, but unfortunately the situation is the same: all the connected resources are refreshed when issuing: Application.get().getEventBus().post(MyObject, pageUuid), not just the one that I'm expecting.\n\nSorry about that, I don't know what could be wrong.\n"}

But if we have a way to dispatch the right event to the right @Subscribe method (or a channel implementation of any sort), maybe we will be able to filter things with more context, so that would be potentially easier.\n\nOK, any thoughts about that?\n\nKind regards,\n\nPierre\nsee code below,i mean something like this,you can change/improve according to your usecase\n\n public class InputWrapper<T> {\n        /**\n         *\n         * @param input\n         * @param id  id is sessionid of sender\n         */\n        public InputWrapper(T input, String  id){\n            this.input=input;\n            this.sender=id;\n        }\n\n        public T getInput() {\n            return input;\n        }\n\n        public String getSender() {\n            return sender;\n        }\n\n        T input;\n        String sender;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * compare sessionid and return true if session id of sender is same as receiver\n     */\n    public  class SomePredicate implements Predicate<InputWrapper>{\n        @Override\n        public boolean apply(@Nullable InputWrapper wrapper) {\n            return wrapper.getSender().equals(Session.get().getId());\n        }\n    }\n\n\nYes, that's totally it! But unfortunately, my arguments below still apply.\n\nPlus, it gives me strange exceptions to use this kind of things: UnknwonBehaviorIdException, NullPointerException because the appended component can't be found, etc. I tried using this kind of code but was forced to strip it because of these exceptions.\nafaik what wicket-atmosphere does is it filters the overall subscribers based on if their corresponding predicate returns true or not when event is posted ,if a predicate of subscriber returns true then the method/subscriber gets invoked else not so in above case with \"SomePredicate\" if client A has sent response then predicate returns true only if A is receiver and hence only A gets response.\ni can't reproduce your exception...\nUnfortunately, my experience is that if a predicate matches for a client and doesn't matches for the others, the matching predicate sends the response to all clients. So in our case the message is sent only once, and not as many times as there are connected clients, but to all the connected clients. Which I find pretty annoying.\n\nRegarding my exception, it only happens when using complex HTML, in one of my projects, it is totally absent. But in another one, it happens on a regular basis.\nI agree that the filter construction is a bit weak. It can only be used to filter on properties of the event itself, not on properties of the receiver. The reason for this is that it is expensive to setup the entire context, such as the session and a request cycle. I think it should be possible to add a second filter that runs inside the AtmosphereRequestHandler, at which point the session, request cylcle and even the page are available.\nI've just pushed the implementation of a context aware filter. I've also updated the example to show how this works. Be advised though that filtering within the context of a Wicket request cyle is expensive. If you can implement the desired behavior via the Atmosphere API, I suggest you do so, because that should be much less expensive.\n\nWrapping the Atmosphere api is not what Wicket-Atmosphere is for, it is a bridge not a wrapper.\nGood evening,\n\nI've just tried it. The behaviour is the same: if three clients are connected and that only one's filter returns true, then the same message goes to all the three clients. If two of them return true, then those two send the message to the three clients, and so on.\n\nPersonally, I'd like to be able to have the message sent by one client broadcasted to only this client. Of course, the use case of \"one client sends to all\" is useful, I just wish it was not the only one possible.\n\nAnyway, your \"contextAwareFilter\" is useful, thanks for that !\n\nI've tried myself to implement a Broadcaster-based message-sending in your code, but for the moment, I failed. Too bad. The one thing I miss is how to provide an AtmosphereResource to my Broadcaster.\n\nAnyway, keep up the good work! :-)\nI don't see how you could return true for one client and false for another (other than using something like random). filter() is used with no receiver context at all. It is meant to be used to filter certain types of events (other than the actual instance type). For example, if you have an event that contains progress of a job and you only want your component to receive the events if the progress is 80% or higher, that's when you use filter(). The same filter should always return true for the same events.\n\nCan you take a look at commit a5421ec488020a3835d49962e1f772dc1435e230? I've added methods to post an event to a single resource, either with a resource instance or via its uuid (which I think makes more sense). You can get the UUID with AtmosphereResource.getUUID(page).\nThanks again! I've tried this new code, but unfortunately the situation is the same: all the connected resources are refreshed when issuing: Application.get().getEventBus().post(MyObject, pageUuid), not just the one that I'm expecting.\n\nSorry about that, I don't know what could be wrong.\n"}

This is often useful but also can be really nasty sometimes. Imagine you have a text input field to enter the ISBN of a book (size: 13 digits). While typing any parts of the book's title, author, genre, year or ISBN the autocompleter should pop up a list of book entries which contain the matching input string:\n\n  autocompleter output (structure)\n\n  --- item 1 ---\n  ISBN 1\n  AUTHOR 1\n  TITLE 1\n  GENRE 1\n  YEAR 1 \n  --- item 2 ---\n  ISBN 2\n  AUTHOR 2\n  TITLE 2\n  GENRE 2\n  YEAR 2\n  --------------\n  ...\n  --- item n ---\n\nWhen pressing enter the input field will be set to the ISBN of the currently selected book.\n\nBTW since WICKET-488 is resolved the other read-only fields of the form will contain title, author, etc. (Thanks, Igor!! :-)\n\nNow the problem: Typically the width of the autocompleter entry shown in the popup (especially the book title) will be a lot longer than the 13 digit ISBN number. The only chance to grow the wicket autocompleter window to the required size is to make the input field ridiculously long so the windows will adjust to that size. This is really ugly and wastes a lot of space in the user interface for no reason. Also it will confuse the user who thinks the input really needs to be that long.\n\nTypically wicket's autocompleter markup looks like this:\n\n HTML\n\n  <div id=\"isbn1-autocomplete-container\" style=\"overflow: auto; position: absolute; left: 8px; top: 30px; width: 155px;\" class=\"wicket-aa-container\">\n  \t  <div class=\"wicket-aa\" id=\"text1-autocomplete\">\n\t\t  <ul>\n  \t\t      <li class=\"selected\" textvalue=\"978-1932394986\">.....</li>\n\t\t      <li textvalue=\"978-1932394222\">.....</li>\n\t\t      ....\n\t\t      <li textvalue=\"978-1932311186\">.....</li>\n\t\t  </ul>\n\t  </div>\n  </div>\n\nThe 'style' attribute in the <div> contains 'width:155px' and is impossible to override from CSS because 'style' is \"stronger\" (the 'cascading' in css).\n\nSo I attached a patch to enable / disable the adjustment of the width to the input field.\n\n  JAVA\n\n    final AutoCompleteSettings opts = new AutoCompleteSettings();\n    opts.setAdjustInputWidth(false);\n    field.add(new AutoCompleteBehavior(renderer, opts)\n    ...\n\nThe markup will now look like this:\n\n  HTML\n\n    <div id=\"isbn1-autocomplete-container\" style=\"overflow: auto; position: absolute; left: 8px; top: 30px;\" class=\"wicket-aa-container\">\n\nNotice the lack of the 'width' attribute...\n\nNow to resolve the problem you could write:\n\n  MYSTYLE.CSS\n\n    .wicket-aa-container {\n      width: 300px; \n    }\n\nHowever this will not only grow the great book autocompleter to the desired width but also all other autocompleters ever being used on the same page (or the scope of the CSS). Also you can _NOT_ do this:\n\n  MYSTYLE.CSS\n\n    #isbn1-autocomplete-container {\n      width: 300px;\n    }\n\nBecause a linked stylesheet is typically static (and cached by the browser) and the DOM id of the autocompleter is generated dynamically. And, no: I don't consider generating dynamic CSS an option for such a simple problem.\n\nSo what would be just great is the possibility to add an extra css class to the container tag:\n\n  JAVA\n\n    final AutoCompleteSettings opts = new AutoCompleteSettings();\n    opts.setCssClassName(\"book-autocompleter\");\n    opts.setAdjustInputWidth(false);\n    field.add(new AutoCompleteBehavior(renderer, opts)\n    ...\n\n  HTML\n\n    <div id=\"isbn1-autocomplete-container\" style=\"overflow: auto; position: absolute; left: 8px; top: 30px;\" class=\"wicket-aa-container book-autocompleter\">\n\nYou will immediately notice the additional class name 'book-autocompleter'\n\n  MYSTYLE.CSS\n\n    .book-autocompleter {\n      width: 300px;\n    }\n\n\nTo summarize my patch:\n\n\nTwo extra methods in org.apache.wicket.extensions.ajax.markup.html.autocomplete.AutoCompleteSettings\n\n\n  /**\n   * Sets an CSS class name to add to the autocompleter markup container\n   * <p/>\n   * This makes it easier to have multiple autocompleters in your application\n   * with different style and layout.\n   *\n   * @param cssClassName valid CSS class name\n   */\n  public void setCssClassName(final String cssClassName)\n\n\n  /**\n   * Adjust the width of the autocompleter selection window to the width of the related input field.\n   * <p/>\n   * Otherwise the size will depend on the default browser behavior and CSS.\n   *\n    * @param adjustInputWidth  <code>true</code> if the autocompleter should have the same size  as\n   *                           the input field, <code>false</code> for default browser behavior\n   */\n    public void setAdjustInputWidth(final boolean adjustInputWidth)\n\n\nUnless you call these methods the autocompleter will behave exactly as before so this will not break previous code.\n\n\nWould be just great to see this patch applied :-)\nWow, that was quick!

Also it will confuse the user who thinks the input really needs to be that long.\n\nTypically wicket's autocompleter markup looks like this:\n\n HTML\n\n  <div id=\"isbn1-autocomplete-container\" style=\"overflow: auto; position: absolute; left: 8px; top: 30px; width: 155px;\" class=\"wicket-aa-container\">\n  \t  <div class=\"wicket-aa\" id=\"text1-autocomplete\">\n\t\t  <ul>\n  \t\t      <li class=\"selected\" textvalue=\"978-1932394986\">.....</li>\n\t\t      <li textvalue=\"978-1932394222\">.....</li>\n\t\t      ....\n\t\t      <li textvalue=\"978-1932311186\">.....</li>\n\t\t  </ul>\n\t  </div>\n  </div>\n\nThe 'style' attribute in the <div> contains 'width:155px' and is impossible to override from CSS because 'style' is \"stronger\" (the 'cascading' in css).\n\nSo I attached a patch to enable / disable the adjustment of the width to the input field.\n\n  JAVA\n\n    final AutoCompleteSettings opts = new AutoCompleteSettings();\n    opts.setAdjustInputWidth(false);\n    field.add(new AutoCompleteBehavior(renderer, opts)\n    ...\n\nThe markup will now look like this:\n\n  HTML\n\n    <div id=\"isbn1-autocomplete-container\" style=\"overflow: auto; position: absolute; left: 8px; top: 30px;\" class=\"wicket-aa-container\">\n\nNotice the lack of the 'width' attribute...\n\nNow to resolve the problem you could write:\n\n  MYSTYLE.CSS\n\n    .wicket-aa-container {\n      width: 300px; \n    }\n\nHowever this will not only grow the great book autocompleter to the desired width but also all other autocompleters ever being used on the same page (or the scope of the CSS). Also you can _NOT_ do this:\n\n  MYSTYLE.CSS\n\n    #isbn1-autocomplete-container {\n      width: 300px;\n    }\n\nBecause a linked stylesheet is typically static (and cached by the browser) and the DOM id of the autocompleter is generated dynamically. And, no: I don't consider generating dynamic CSS an option for such a simple problem.\n\nSo what would be just great is the possibility to add an extra css class to the container tag:\n\n  JAVA\n\n    final AutoCompleteSettings opts = new AutoCompleteSettings();\n    opts.setCssClassName(\"book-autocompleter\");\n    opts.setAdjustInputWidth(false);\n    field.add(new AutoCompleteBehavior(renderer, opts)\n    ...\n\n  HTML\n\n    <div id=\"isbn1-autocomplete-container\" style=\"overflow: auto; position: absolute; left: 8px; top: 30px;\" class=\"wicket-aa-container book-autocompleter\">\n\nYou will immediately notice the additional class name 'book-autocompleter'\n\n  MYSTYLE.CSS\n\n    .book-autocompleter {\n      width: 300px;\n    }\n\n\nTo summarize my patch:\n\n\nTwo extra methods in org.apache.wicket.extensions.ajax.markup.html.autocomplete.AutoCompleteSettings\n\n\n  /**\n   * Sets an CSS class name to add to the autocompleter markup container\n   * <p/>\n   * This makes it easier to have multiple autocompleters in your application\n   * with different style and layout.\n   *\n   * @param cssClassName valid CSS class name\n   */\n  public void setCssClassName(final String cssClassName)\n\n\n  /**\n   * Adjust the width of the autocompleter selection window to the width of the related input field.\n   * <p/>\n   * Otherwise the size will depend on the default browser behavior and CSS.\n   *\n    * @param adjustInputWidth  <code>true</code> if the autocompleter should have the same size  as\n   *                           the input field, <code>false</code> for default browser behavior\n   */\n    public void setAdjustInputWidth(final boolean adjustInputWidth)\n\n\nUnless you call these methods the autocompleter will behave exactly as before so this will not break previous code.\n\n\nWould be just great to see this patch applied :-)\nWow, that was quick! Thank you :-)\n"}

But it would be great to have a link to the Broadcaster API from Atmosphere, which I think, supports this kind of things.That would probably be way more efficient than PerRequestBroadcastFilter tweaking.\n\nAs of today, when posting a message to the event bus, all pages who have the @Subscribed-decorated method suitable to process this message will do it, which is not always desirable.\n\nI'm looking forward to hear from you.\n\nRegards\nI've attached a quickstart demonstrating the fact that when posting to the event bus, all clients registered to that resource receive the message. But, it is visually obvious in this example that it is not desired behaviour.\n\nFYI, it's based on Emond's own quickstart.\ndoesn't adding custom predicate in @Subscribe  solves the problem? \n\n\n\nNot really, because if you post on the event bus with two clients registered, if I understand things correctly, the predicate which returns true sends the response to both clients, even if the other one returns false.\n\nLet me explain a little more what is the current behaviour. Let's say that two clients A & B have the right @Subscribe method. Let's say that you send an event e to the event bus for that method. Then A processes e and sends the same response to both A & B. Then B processes the same event and sends a response to both A & B, too. So we have two responses received by both A & B. I have an app where it's visually obvious: I send a small notification in my @Subscribe method. The notification displays two times in each browser A & B. Which is what make me think it works like that. Plus, it looks consistent with what I know from Atmosphere's Meteor API (which is called under the hood). Hence the request for a Broadcaster-based solution.\n\nIf I use a predicate which returns true for A and false for B, here is what apparently occurs: A sends its response to both A & B since the predicate returns true. And B doesn't send anything since the predicate returns false. But the * same * response returns to both A & B since it comes from A.\n\nWhat I would like to be able to do is to have a response computed by B's AtmosphereBehavior instance sent to B and a response computed by A's AtmosphereBehavior instance sent to A. Because those 2 responses can potentially be a little bit different from each other.\n\nDoes it make sense? Am I doing assumptions that I should not?\n\nOne more thing. Quoting wicket-atmosphere's JavaDoc: \"The filter cannot rely on any context. For example, the RequestCycle may not be available\". This seems to me a little bit limited. I fully understand why this is like this for the predicate. But if we have a way to dispatch the right event to the right @Subscribe method (or a channel implementation of any sort), maybe we will be able to filter things with more context, so that would be potentially easier.\n\nOK, any thoughts about that?\n\nKind regards,\n\nPierre\nsee code below,i mean something like this,you can change/improve according to your usecase\n\n public class InputWrapper<T> {\n        /**\n         *\n         * @param input\n         * @param id  id is sessionid of sender\n         */\n        public InputWrapper(T input, String  id){\n            this.input=input;\n            this.sender=id;\n        }\n\n        public T getInput() {\n            return input;\n        }\n\n        public String getSender() {\n            return sender;\n        }\n\n        T input;\n        String sender;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * compare sessionid and return true if session id of sender is same as receiver\n     */\n    public  class SomePredicate implements Predicate<InputWrapper>{\n        @Override\n        public boolean apply(@Nullable InputWrapper wrapper) {\n            return wrapper.getSender().equals(Session.get().getId());\n        }\n    }\n\n\nYes, that's totally it! But unfortunately, my arguments below still apply.\n\nPlus, it gives me strange exceptions to use this kind of things: UnknwonBehaviorIdException, NullPointerException because the appended component can't be found, etc. I tried using this kind of code but was forced to strip it because of these exceptions.\nafaik what wicket-atmosphere does is it filters the overall subscribers based on if their corresponding predicate returns true or not when event is posted ,if a predicate of subscriber returns true then the method/subscriber gets invoked else not so in above case with \"SomePredicate\" if client A has sent response then predicate returns true only if A is receiver and hence only A gets response.\ni can't reproduce your exception...\nUnfortunately, my experience is that if a predicate matches for a client and doesn't matches for the others, the matching predicate sends the response to all clients. So in our case the message is sent only once, and not as many times as there are connected clients, but to all the connected clients. Which I find pretty annoying.\n\nRegarding my exception, it only happens when using complex HTML, in one of my projects, it is totally absent. But in another one, it happens on a regular basis.\nI agree that the filter construction is a bit weak. It can only be used to filter on properties of the event itself, not on properties of the receiver. The reason for this is that it is expensive to setup the entire context, such as the session and a request cycle. I think it should be possible to add a second filter that runs inside the AtmosphereRequestHandler, at which point the session, request cylcle and even the page are available.\nI've just pushed the implementation of a context aware filter. I've also updated the example to show how this works. Be advised though that filtering within the context of a Wicket request cyle is expensive. If you can implement the desired behavior via the Atmosphere API, I suggest you do so, because that should be much less expensive.\n\nWrapping the Atmosphere api is not what Wicket-Atmosphere is for, it is a bridge not a wrapper.\nGood evening,\n\nI've just tried it. The behaviour is the same: if three clients are connected and that only one's filter returns true, then the same message goes to all the three clients. If two of them return true, then those two send the message to the three clients, and so on.\n\nPersonally, I'd like to be able to have the message sent by one client broadcasted to only this client. Of course, the use case of \"one client sends to all\" is useful, I just wish it was not the only one possible.\n\nAnyway, your \"contextAwareFilter\" is useful, thanks for that !\n\nI've tried myself to implement a Broadcaster-based message-sending in your code, but for the moment, I failed. Too bad. The one thing I miss is how to provide an AtmosphereResource to my Broadcaster.\n\nAnyway, keep up the good work! :-)\nI don't see how you could return true for one client and false for another (other than using something like random). filter() is used with no receiver context at all. It is meant to be used to filter certain types of events (other than the actual instance type). For example, if you have an event that contains progress of a job and you only want your component to receive the events if the progress is 80% or higher, that's when you use filter(). The same filter should always return true for the same events.\n\nCan you take a look at commit a5421ec488020a3835d49962e1f772dc1435e230? I've added methods to post an event to a single resource, either with a resource instance or via its uuid (which I think makes more sense). You can get the UUID with AtmosphereResource.getUUID(page).\nThanks again! I've tried this new code, but unfortunately the situation is the same: all the connected resources are refreshed when issuing: Application.get().getEventBus().post(MyObject, pageUuid), not just the one that I'm expecting.\n\nSorry about that, I don't know what could be wrong.\n"}

But if you type any wrong url such as \"http://localhost:8080/bug/aaaaaa\" the page doesn't have styles and images.\nSample project based on quickstart maven project.\nThe problem is that ServletWebRequest#getClientUrl method is returning a client URL that includes the context path. When responding it uses the errorAttributes.getRequestUri() URL to create the client one.\nI don't know why ServletWebRequest#getClientUrl is testing error attributes in request and using the error URI, it is the address of the resource causing problems, but getClientUrl is designed to to return only the base URL without context or filter mapping.\n\nSimply remove the test for error attributes an its logic fix this BUG and have no impact at WICKET-3599, WICKET-3551 but breaks some test expectations.\nI think it should use error URI, because actual page could be on different level, not in root as /404. A test case for the fix should include urls like \"\"http://localhost:8080/bug/aaaaaa/bbbb/cccc\".

Just tried it with JBossAS7 and Tomcat 7.0.22. Fails everywhere. I suspect you have deployed it on ROOT once, and \"../../\" works.\n\nAs I see, the problem is in the getClientUrl method. If it's normal page it uses the private method \"getUrl\", and it does remove context and filter paths, but for an error page it doesn't. Hence all resource relative urls have extra 2 levels up \"../../\".\nI did: \n- mvn package\n- cp target/*.war $TC7/webapps/4168.war\n- start TC7\n- open http://localhost:8080/4168 (home page)\n- open http://localhost:8080/4168/gfshhffdhdhdh (the error page)\n- open http://localhost:8080/4168/404 (the error page)\nFix added\nI do exactly the same!

Also could you try \"http://localhost:8080/4168/gf/s/h/h/f/fdhdhdh\" please?\nHi, in order to simulate the bug here using Firefox I have to clean the browser cache each time I go to the problematic URL.\nOh, also the the context path can't be empty.

So c1's time will include the time of c2, c3, ... as well and wont be very accurate.\n\n2) Render time problem\nWicket does something like:\nfor (Component child : this) {\n  child.onBeforeRender();\n}\nfor (Component child : this) {\n  child.render();\n}\nfor (Component child : this) {\n  child.onAfterRender();\n}\nso we measure the whole time for all components, not just the component's onBefore->onAfter time.\nIf we find this functionality useful then we will need to add yet another callbacks: onPreRender and onPostRender, i.e.:\nfor (Component child : this) {\n getApplication().getOnPreRenderListeners().onPreRender(child);\n child.render();\n getApplication().getOnPostRenderListeners().onPostRender(child);\n}\n\nThis way each component will report its time and its parent will have a time which is a sum of all children + its own time.\nNo need of OnPreRender/onPostRender listeners. All this is possible even now with Behavior.before/afterRender().\nyou are not going to add a behavior to every single component instance out there, are you?\nWith r1165186 I added org.apache.wicket.devutils.inspector.RenderPerformanceListener.accepts(Component) that can filter which components' render time should be measured.

By calling ISessionStore#invalidate(Request) and #bind Call upon login to protect against session fixation.", "commitId": "8b73aaefe7eafbea1c5642e8a58bcc652e8b1f6e", "issueId": "WICKET-1767", "issueString": "Protection against Session Fixation\nSecuring a Wicket application against Session Fixation attacks (http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Fixation) is currently not trivial. This is especially problematic as most Java webservers fall back to URL rewriting when the user disabled cookies. The session is gets appended to the URL and its trivial to steal a session.\n\nTo protect against session fixation, the HTTP session must be invalidated and recreated on login, giving the user a new session id. The following code does exactly that, it must be called before loggin in the user (eg. store credentials). A redirect isn't required, though it should be part of the login-form anyway.\n\nISessionStore store = Application.get().getSessionStore();\nRequest request = RequestCycle.get().getRequest();\nstore.invalidate(request);\nSession session = Application.get().newSession(request, RequestCycle.get().getResponse());\nsession.bind();\nstore.bind(request, session);\n\nCalling session.invalidateNow() does NOT work (I have no idea why).\n\nI'd like to see support for this as part of Wicket - it took me about 6 hours to figure out the Wicket internals and produce these 6 lines of code. Others shouldn't have to bother with that.\n\nI can't provide a testcase. Applications work fine without the addition, but leave users vulnerable to the session-fixation. Manual testing has to look at the session id (eg. via Firebug's Net tab) before and after a login.\nthe first 3 lines are exactly what session.invalidate does\n\nBut we dont create a new session right away. And i think that is the problem\nBut what you coud try is doing this:\n\nsession.invalidateNow()\nSession.unset();\n\n\nThanks for the comment Johan.\n\ninvalidateNow actually does more then just store.invalidate(request). It also sets the invalited flag, which has some, in this case, undesired side effects. I didn't understand what exactly happens, but its definitely not the same.\n\nCalling Session.unset() didn't help either.\nthat flag shouldnt be in the way one bit\nIt just says that the session is invalidate or should invalidate\n\nso for the rest it does exactly teh same is the 3 first lines:\n\ngetSessionStore().invalidate(RequestCycle.get().getRequest());\n\nThen i you call Session.unset()\nand then you ask for a session again (when you login in)\nYou should get a new one. I guess you really also should call bind() on it because you do want to store it and i guess we dont know that yet\n\nSo\nsession.invalidatNow()\nSession.unset()\nSession.get().bind();\n\n\nIf that doenst work then i guess that something goes wrong in the bind() call and i guess thats related with:\n\nif (store.lookup(request) == null)\n\nMaybe that somehow sees still the old session.\nI lack the necessary knowledge about Wicket internals, so I was trying out things while reading bits of Wicket source code.\n\nsession.invalidatNow()\nSession.unset()\nSession.get().bind(); \n\nThose didn't work. One possible issue with Session.get(), called after invalidate/unset could be that get() actually creates the session, but without creating a HTTP session.\n\nAlso store.lookup has to return null, as store.invalidate(request) kills the HTTP session, and lookup takes the session id and uses getAttribute to access the HTTP session.\n\nMy code seems to work because, in constract to the various \"alternatives\", it first invalidates the HTTP session, then creates a new Wicket Session (via Application#newSession, then binds it to the HTTP session (creating a new one), then binding it to the SessionStore.\n\nWhat do you think? Would a simple test application, that does nothing but login in with a single button and outputting the session id help?\nno this is just weird\nIt has to be in the last bind() call that you do the rest is exactly the same\n\nsession.invalidatNow()\nSession.unset()\nsession = Session.get();\nsession.bind()\n\ni guess that last call is just a NOP. doesnt do anything because store.lookup() still returns something.\n\nfor example after that sesion.bind() call does the session have an id?\n\nthis code has to work it is just exactly the same as yours i cant see any difference and then it is just the rebinding in the same request that goes wrong\n\nsession.invalidatNow()\nSession.unset()\nsession = Session.get(); << this should now be another instance of session!\nApplication.get().getSessionStore().bind(request, session); \n\nthe only thing is that session doesnt have an id then i think.\n\nTried this:\n\nget().invalidateNow();\nSession.unset();\nSession session = Session.get();\nsession.bind();\nApplication.get().getSessionStore().bind(request(), session);\n\nWithout the session.bind() no new HttpSession is created, resulting in a NullPointerException in SessionStore. With the bind-call, as above, it just doesn't work.\n\nSome further experimentation showed that this works, somewhat simplifying my initial solution:\n\nApplication.get().getSessionStore().invalidate(RequestCycle.get().getRequest());\nSession session = Session.get();\nsession.bind();\nApplication.get().getSessionStore().bind(request(), session);\n\nReplacing the first line with get().invalidateNow() does NOT work. So that sessionInvalidated flag in Session must have some undesired sideeffect, as that is the only difference between Session#invalidateNow and my code.\nthat that code works is weird you dont even call unset() !\nSo the second line where you do session.get() you should get the same session that is already stored in the thread local\n\n\nI still dont get what that sessioninvalidate flag has to do with anything.\nIf you call Session.unset()\nand then Session.get() then you have a new session. That that old object with that flag is not used anymore..\nSo how can it be in the way??\n\nSo you are saying that you have to call session.bind() else you dont have a new httpsession. then what thought would go wrong that it would go into this if\n\n\tif (store.lookup(request) == null)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t// explicitly create a session\n\t\t\tid = store.getSessionId(request, true);\n\t\t\t// bind it\n\t\t\tstore.bind(request, this);\n\nisnt the case. So your call that you do also your self:\nApplication.get().getSessionStore().bind(request(), session); \n\nis already done. so why do you have to call it a second time also yourself? This all doesnt make sense.\n\n\nI can only repeat myself - and provide a testapp if that helps. You're welcome to give it a try yourself, I don't see how we could get any further otherwise.\ngive me a test case then if you cant debug it what is really different\nBecause currently the only thing i see to fix this is doing that Session.unset() in the invalidateNow() call\n\nEverything should work then  (if you call bind() your self in your login code)\nI just noticed an interesting thing here: I'm not calling Session.unset, thats why it works at all. Basically I'm replacing the HTTP session WITHOUT(!) replacing the Wicket Session - it just gets bound to the new HTTP session, and thats it.\n\nThats why invalidateNow doesn't work: The Session is marked as invalid and rebinding it fails.\n\nGood to finalize realize that. All wicket related state is bound to the wicket Session object. By just rebinding it to a new Session, everything continues to work as intentended. Creating a new wicket Session kills the state that has to be maintained.\n\nAssuming the session-fixation-protection is a desired feature, can we add something to Session that makes this easier to use and much easier to document? Something like Session.get().replace().\n\n/**\n * Replaces the underlying HTTP Session, invalidating the current one and\n * creating a new one.\n * <p>\n * Call upon login to protect against session fixation.\n * \n * @see http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Fixation\n */\npublic void replace() {\n\tgetSessionStore().invalidate(RequestCycle.get().getRequest());\n\tbind();\n\tgetSessionStore().bind(RequestCycle.get().getRequest(), this);\n}\nif you are not replacing the old session instance with the new, then it is possible to still access stale values from the old session instance during that request...\nI don't consider that a problem. On the hand, the old session got invalidet, so there is no way it still contains stale values. On the other, I don't need to invalidate Wickets Session state, all I need is a new HTTP session. After all, the point isn't to remove Wicket's session state, but to get a new session id.\nthe stale state might not be in the actual httpsession, but it remains in wicket's session object attached to the current thread, and is not synced into httpsession until the end of requests afaik. so there is still a problem there, because between you calling invalidate() and the end of the request you can have business logic acting on old values it stored in wicket's session object.\nso the only thing you want to do is remove the http session but nothing more?\n\n((WebRequest)RequestCycle.get().getRequest()).getHttpServletRequest().getSession().invalidate()\nsession.bind()\n\n\n\nThanks Johan, that makes it even shorter.\n\nThis works fine:\n\n/**\n * Replaces the underlying HTTP Session, invalidating the current one and\n * creating a new one.\n * <p>\n * Call upon login to protect against session fixation.\n * \n * @see http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Fixation\n */\npublic void replace() {\n\t((WebRequest)RequestCycle.get().getRequest()).getHttpServletRequest().getSession().invalidate();\n\tbind();\n}\nthat is something we cant add to Session but maybe to the WebSession subclass.\ni dont like the name replace() to much..\na bit more explicit like invalidateHttpSession() or replaceHttpSession() (in WebSession not Session)\n\nigor should we add this to the api what do you think?\nreplaceHttpSession() in WebSession sounds good.\n\nBy the way, I'm still wondering why Wicket has the seperatation of a non-web-layer and a WebXXX-layer on top of that. Can you give me an idea about that? I haven't seen any hint at usage of Wicket in non-http scenerios...\nfor example there was/is talk about a Wap implementation\nalso the portlets are implemented a bit different, but thats only for the special request/response wrappers \n\nbut currently the only impl is really the http/web implementation but the base is http/web free\na while ago someone also used wicket with apache mina instead of wicket running in jetty. so the separation is used, albeit seldomly.\nAny plans to fix this? It doesn't affect any existing code and its only four lines of code...\nwill try to apply it in 1.4\njohan, should we just add bind() call to session.invalidatenow()? seems like that is the only missing bit and it would make more sense there then in yet another method.\nthat doesnt sound logical to me\nif i call invalidateNow() of a wicket session then it doesnt say to me that that where i just called invalidateNow() on is then added to a new HttpSession so it is kind of still alive not really invalidated at all (at least not the object i called it on)\n\nAnd then the boolean in the wicket session \nsessionInvalidated = true; // set this for isSessionInvalidated\n\nis telling us what?...\n\nno i guess having a nice method like replaceHttpSession is way better.\ni added this method:\n\t/**\n\t * Replaces the underlying (Web)Session, invalidating the current one and creating a new one. By\n\t * calling {@link ISessionStore#invalidate(Request)} and {@link #bind()}\n\t * <p>\n\t * Call upon login to protect against session fixation.\n\t * \n\t * @see \"http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Fixation\"\n\t */\n\tpublic void replaceSession()\n\t{\n\t\tgetSessionStore().invalidate(RequestCycle.get().getRequest());\n\t\tbind();\n\t}\n\ni think thats the nicest thing to have (maybe a better method name anyone?)\n"}
